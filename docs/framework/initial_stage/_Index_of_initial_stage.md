# Initial stage: index

This index summarizes the **initial-stage** framework documents and adds a short
orientation for each area. The autogenerated list is kept intact for the
Obsidian plugin, but the narrative below is the human-friendly entry point.

## Quick map

- **Scope and boundaries** → what the framework owns vs. what stays project‑specific.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Framework boundaries|Framework boundaries]]
- **Discovery + context** → how nodes are found, registered, and built.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Application context and discovery|Application context and discovery]]
- **Factory/injection model** → how nodes are created, how config and dependencies flow.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Factory and injection model|Factory and injection model]]
- **Config strictness** → how strict mode behaves and when we allow fallbacks.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Injection and strict mode|Injection and strict mode]]
- **Injection plumbing** → registry, scopes, and resolution mechanics.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Injection registry|Injection registry]]
- **Node/stage semantics** → definitions, metadata, and grouping.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Node and stage specifications|Node and stage specifications]]
- **Scenario vs node axes** → how scenarios intersect with node groups.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Scenario vs node axes|Scenario vs node axes]]
- **Auto-discovery policy** → module scanning rules and exclusions.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Auto-discovery policy|Auto-discovery policy]]
- **Tracing runtime** → runtime tracing configuration and sinks.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Tracing runtime|Tracing runtime]]
- **Tracing notes** → stub/placeholder notes for tracing.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Tracing|Tracing]]
