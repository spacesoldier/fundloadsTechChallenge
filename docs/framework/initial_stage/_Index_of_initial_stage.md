# Initial stage: index

This index summarizes the **initial-stage** framework documents and adds a short
orientation for each area. The autogenerated list is kept intact for the
Obsidian plugin, but the narrative below is the human-friendly entry point.

## Quick map

- **Scope and boundaries** → what the framework owns vs. what stays project‑specific.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Framework boundaries|Framework boundaries]]
- **Discovery + context** → how nodes are found, registered, and built.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Application context and discovery|Application context and discovery]]
- **Factory/injection model** → how nodes are created, how config and dependencies flow.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Factory and injection model|Factory and injection model]]
- **Config strictness** → how strict mode behaves and when we allow fallbacks.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Injection and strict mode|Injection and strict mode]]
- **Injection plumbing** → registry, scopes, and resolution mechanics.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Injection registry|Injection registry]]
- **Service model** → when to use service layer over raw adapters and how services are scoped/injected.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Service model|Service model]]
- **Node/stage semantics** → definitions, metadata, and grouping.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Node and stage specifications|Node and stage specifications]]
- **Scenario vs node axes** → how scenarios intersect with node groups.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Scenario vs node axes|Scenario vs node axes]]
- **Auto-discovery policy** → module scanning rules and exclusions.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Auto-discovery policy|Auto-discovery policy]]
- **Tracing runtime** → runtime tracing configuration and sinks.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Tracing runtime|Tracing runtime]]
- **Execution runtime + routing** → how Runner integrates with Router and queues.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Execution runtime and routing integration|Execution runtime and routing integration]]
- **Execution planning model** → queue/pool strategy and sync/async split.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Execution planning model|Execution planning model]]
- **Ports and adapters model** → abstraction rules for ports/adapters.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Ports and adapters model|Ports and adapters model]]
- **Router + DAG roadmap** → checklist for routing/DAG migration.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Router and DAG roadmap|Router and DAG roadmap]]
- **Routing semantics** → envelope, targets, and multi-output rules.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/Routing semantics|Routing semantics]]
- **DAG construction** → analytic graph rules and test cases.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/DAG construction|DAG construction]]
- **Work plans (incremental)** → short-lived execution/migration plans.  
  See: [[docs/framework/initial_stage/_work/_Index_of__work|_work index]]
